# LANL-Earthquake-Prediction

## Description

Forecasting earthquakes is one of the most important problems in Earth science because of their devastating consequences. Current scientific studies related to earthquake forecasting focus on three key points: when the event will occur, where it will occur, and how large it will be.

In this competition, I will address when the earthquake will take place. Specifically, youâ€™ll predict the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur from real-time seismic data.

If this challenge is solved and the physics are ultimately shown to scale from the laboratory to the field, researchers will have the potential to improve earthquake hazard assessments that could save lives and billions of dollars in infrastructure.

This challenge is hosted by Los Alamos National Laboratory which enhances national security by ensuring the safety of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, developing technologies to reduce threats from weapons of mass destruction, and solving problems related to energy, environment, infrastructure, health, and global security concerns.

## Dataset Description
The goal of this competition is to use seismic signals to predict the timing of laboratory earthquakes. The data comes from a well-known experimental set-up used to study earthquake physics. The acoustic_data input signal is used to predict the time remaining before the next laboratory earthquake (`time_to_failure`).

The training data is a single, continuous segment of experimental data. The test data consists of a folder containing many small segments. The data within each test file is continuous, but the test files do not represent a continuous segment of the experiment; thus, the predictions cannot be assumed to follow the same regular pattern seen in the training file.

For each `seg_id` in the test folder, you should predict a single `time_to_failure` corresponding to the time between the last row of the segment and the next laboratory earthquake.

## Additional Information

The data are from an experiment conducted on rock in a double direct shear geometry subjected to bi-axial loading, a classic laboratory earthquake model (fig. a)

Two fault gouge layers are sheared simultaneously while subjected to a constant normal load and a prescribed shear velocity. The laboratory faults fail in repetitive cycles of stick and slip that is meant to mimic the cycle of loading and failure on tectonic faults. While the experiment is considerably simpler than a fault in Earth, it shares many physical characteristics. (fig. b)

Los Alamos' initial work showed that the prediction of laboratory earthquakes from continuous seismic data is possible in the case of quasi-periodic laboratory seismic cycles. In this competition, the team has provided a much more challenging dataset with considerably more aperiodic earthquake failures.
